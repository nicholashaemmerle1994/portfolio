      <div>
        <p className="font-text">Hey there! </p>
        <p>I'm a front-end and back-end developer who's passionate about creating digital products that are creative, fast and user-friendly. I've always been fascinated by technology, starting from game consoles to working with computer software and building my own computer.</p>
        <p>
          Before I got into tech, I used to work as a bartender and mailman. But my love for technology eventually led me to pursue a career in development. I moved to Vienna three years ago to further my career and I've been loving it here ever since. When I'm not working, you can usually find me
          at the gym or curled up with a good comic book or TV show.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, and I'm a bit of a coffee addict too! If you want to nerd out about, espresso, coffee grinders, machines or comic books, just shoot me a message on LinkedIn or write me a mail. <br />
          I'm excited to see where my career in development takes me, and I'm looking forward to meeting new people and making new friends along the way!
